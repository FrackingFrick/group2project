# group2project

Our project is to create a simple webpage for new Oulu-dwellers to find some places to spend time. It has some shops, bars, restaurants etc we ourselves have found to be nice to visit.
We also added a map so you can plan visiting few places at once.
In the end the logic in map doesn't quite work but other parts are functional!
